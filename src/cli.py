    AITA for refusing to give my sister money for her wedding?
    
    So basically, my sister Sarah (28F) is getting married next month and has been asking everyone in the family for money to help pay for her "dream wedding." The thing is, she's been planning this huge expensive wedding that costs like $50,000 and she and her fianc√© only make about $60,000 combined per year.
    
    I (25M) just graduated college and started my first job. I'm making decent money but I'm also paying off student loans and trying to save up to move out of my parents' house. When Sarah asked me for $2,000 to help with the wedding, I told her I couldn't afford it right now.
    
    She completely lost it and started yelling at me, saying I was being selfish and that "family should support each other." She said I was ruining her special day and that I obviously don't care about her happiness. My parents are now pressuring me to give her the money because "it's her wedding and she'll only get married once."
    
    But here's the thing - Sarah has always been terrible with money. She's constantly buying expensive clothes and going on vacations she can't afford, and then asks the family to bail her out. I'm tired of enabling her bad financial decisions.
    
    I told her that if she wanted a cheaper wedding, she could have one, but I'm not going to go into debt to fund her expensive taste. Now half the family is mad at me and saying I'm being an asshole.
    
    AITA for refusing to give my sister money for her wedding?
    
    Edit: Thanks for all the responses. I talked to my parents and they agreed that Sarah needs to learn financial responsibility.
