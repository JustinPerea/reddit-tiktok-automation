# Reddit-to-TikTok Automation System: Complete Development Specification

## Project Overview

**Objective**: Create a streamlined system that enables content creators to efficiently convert Reddit stories into TikTok-ready videos through manual content curation and automated video production.

**Core Philosophy**: Bypass web scraping and API limitations by using manual content selection with automated video generation, ensuring legal compliance while maintaining quality control.

## System Architecture

### High-Level Workflow
1. **Content Discovery**: User browses Reddit normally via browser or mobile app
2. **Manual Content Input**: User copy-pastes selected content into local processing system
3. **Content Processing**: Local system validates, cleans, and enhances content
4. **Video Generation**: Automated pipeline creates TikTok-ready videos
5. **Review & Publishing**: User reviews and approves final videos

### Phase 1 MVP Architecture (Manual Copy-Paste Focus)

   User browses      Copy-paste text    Content validation     MP4 videos
   finds content     into interface     TTS generation         ready for
   manually          for processing     Video assembly         TikTok upload
```

### Future Enhanced Architecture (Phases 2-4)
```
[Reddit] → [Browser Extension] → [Local API] → [Video Generation] → [TikTok]

## Content Processing Pipeline

### Stage 1: Content Validation
**Criteria**:
- Word count: 150-500 words (optimal for 60-90 second videos)
- Completeness: Full story with beginning, middle, end
- Appropriateness: No explicit content, doxxing, or harmful material
- Engagement potential: Emotional hooks, relatable scenarios
- Technical suitability: No excessive formatting, links, or images

**Quality Scoring Algorithm**:
```python
def calculate_quality_score(content):
    score = 0.0
    
    # Length optimization (target: 200-400 words)
    word_count = len(content.split())
    if 200 <= word_count <= 400:
        score += 0.3
    elif 150 <= word_count <= 500:
        score += 0.2
    
    # Emotional engagement detection
    emotional_words = count_emotional_indicators(content)
    score += min(emotional_words * 0.1, 0.3)
    
    # Story structure completeness
    if has_clear_narrative_structure(content):
        score += 0.2
    
    # Readability and TTS optimization
    if is_tts_friendly(content):
        score += 0.2
    
    return min(score, 1.0)
```

### Stage 2: Content Enhancement
**Text Processing**:
- Remove Reddit-specific formatting (AITA, Edit:, Update:)
- Expand abbreviations for TTS clarity
- Add natural pauses and emphasis markers
- Generate engaging hooks and conclusions
- Create platform-specific variations

**Emotional Analysis**:
- Detect primary emotion (anger, sadness, joy, surprise)
- Select appropriate background music and visuals
- Adjust TTS voice parameters for emotional consistency
- Generate emotion-appropriate thumbnails

### Stage 3: Video Generation
**Audio Production**:
- Text-to-speech with emotional inflection
- Background music selection based on story emotion
- Audio mixing and mastering for mobile consumption
- Generate multiple voice variations for A/B testing

**Visual Production**:
- Select background videos from categorized library
- Generate animated text overlays with precise timing
- Create eye-catching thumbnails with emotion-based design
- Ensure TikTok format compliance (1080x1920, 30fps, <3MB)
