# WhisperX and NumPy 2.0+ Compatibility: Complete Solutions Guide

## The NumPy 2.0 compatibility issue stems from breaking C API changes

Based on extensive research, WhisperX's incompatibility with NumPy 2.0+ is caused by binary incompatibility in dependencies, particularly `pyannote.audio`, which was compiled against NumPy 1.x. The error typically manifests as `AttributeError: 'np.NaN' was removed in NumPy 2.0` or module compilation errors. This is a widespread issue affecting many users since NumPy 2.0's release in June 2024.

## Recommended solutions ranked by effectiveness

### 1. Community compatibility package (easiest solution)

The **whisperx-numpy2-compatibility** package provides a drop-in replacement that works with NumPy 2.0+. This community-maintained solution has been actively updated and tested across various systems:

```bash
pip install whisperx-numpy2-compatibility
```

Then import it as:
```python
import whisperx_numpy2_compatibility as whisperx
# Use exactly like regular whisperx
model = whisperx.load_model("large-v2")
```

**Key advantages**: No code changes needed, actively maintained, preserves all WhisperX functionality including word-level timing. The package specifically requires `faster-whisper==1.0.3` to maintain stability.

### 2. Docker containerization for complete isolation

Create a containerized environment that keeps WhisperX with NumPy 1.x completely separate from your other applications:

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.10-slim

# Install system dependencies
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y ffmpeg git

# Install specific NumPy version
RUN pip install "numpy<2.0"

# Install WhisperX
RUN pip install git+https://github.com/m-bain/whisperx.git

WORKDIR /app
```

Deploy as a microservice API:
```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
import whisperx

app = FastAPI()

model = whisperx.load_model("base")

@app.post("/transcribe")
async def transcribe_audio(file: UploadFile):
    # Process audio with word-level timestamps
    audio = whisperx.load_audio(file)
    result = model.transcribe(audio)
    return {"segments": result["segments"]}
```

### 3. Virtual environment isolation strategies

For development environments, create dedicated virtual environments:

**Using venv:**
```bash
python -m venv whisperx_env
source whisperx_env/bin/activate  # Linux/Mac
pip install "numpy<2.0" whisperx
```

**Using conda (more robust):**
```bash
conda create -n whisperx python=3.10 "numpy<2.0"
conda activate whisperx
pip install whisperx
```

**Using Poetry for dependency management:**
```toml
[tool.poetry.dependencies]
python = "^3.10"
numpy = "^1.17,<2.0"
whisperx = "^3.1.1"
```

## Alternative Whisper implementations for NumPy 2.0+

If you're open to alternatives, several Whisper variants work well with NumPy 2.0+:

### stable-ts (excellent for customization)
- **NumPy 2.0+ compatible**: Yes
- **Word-level timing**: Superior accuracy through timestamp stabilization
- **Installation**: `pip install stable-ts`
- **Usage**: 
```python
import stable_whisper
model = stable_whisper.load_model('base')
result = model.transcribe('audio.mp3')
result.to_srt_vtt('output.srt')  # Word-level timestamps
```

### whisper-timestamped (robust timing)
- **NumPy 2.0+ compatible**: Yes
- **Word-level timing**: Uses Dynamic Time Warping for high accuracy
- **Installation**: `pip install whisper-timestamped`
- **Provides confidence scores for each word**

### faster-whisper (speed-optimized)
- **NumPy 2.0+ compatible**: Likely yes (through CTranslate2)
- **Word-level timing**: Standard accuracy, 4x faster
- **Installation**: `pip install faster-whisper`
- **Lower memory usage than original Whisper**

### whisper.cpp (no NumPy dependency)
- **NumPy 2.0+ compatible**: N/A (C++ implementation)
- **Word-level timing**: Available with token timestamps
- **Installation**: `pip install pywhispercpp`
- **Excellent for edge deployment**

## Word-level timing accuracy comparison

For TikTok-style video subtitles, timing accuracy is crucial. Here's how the variants compare:

| Implementation | Timing Precision | Speed | Best For |
|----------------|-----------------|-------|----------|
| **WhisperX** | 50-200ms (best) | 70x realtime | Professional subtitles |
| **stable-ts** | 20ms configurable | 1x realtime | Customizable timing |
| **whisper-timestamped** | Variable | 1x realtime | Multi-language robustness |
| **faster-whisper** | Standard | 4x realtime | Batch processing |

WhisperX remains the gold standard for word-level alignment accuracy due to its wav2vec2 forced alignment approach, making it ideal for your TikTok-style videos where precise word timing matters.

## Production deployment best practices

### Microservice architecture approach
Isolate WhisperX in its own service to prevent dependency conflicts:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml
services:
  whisperx-api:
    build: ./whisperx-service
    environment:
      - NUMPY_VERSION=1.24.4
    ports:
      - "8001:8000"
    
  modern-ml-api:
    build: ./modern-ml-service
    environment:
      - NUMPY_VERSION=2.0.1
    ports:
      - "8002:8000"
```

### Advanced isolation with subprocess wrapper
For maximum isolation without containers:

```python
class WhisperXSubprocessWrapper:
    def __init__(self, env_path="whisperx_env/bin/python"):
        self.python_path = env_path
    
    def transcribe(self, audio_file):
        # Run WhisperX in isolated subprocess
        result = subprocess.run(
            [self.python_path, "whisperx_script.py", audio_file],
            capture_output=True,
            text=True
        )
        return json.loads(result.stdout)
```

### Dependency management strategies
1. **Pin exact versions in production**: `numpy==1.24.4`, `whisperx==3.1.1`
2. **Use lock files**: `poetry.lock`, `Pipfile.lock`, or `requirements.txt` from pip-compile
3. **Implement health checks**: Verify NumPy version on startup
4. **Monitor for updates**: The official fix is expected in H2 2025

## Current status and future outlook

As of January 2025:
- **Official WhisperX**: No NumPy 2.0 support timeline announced
- **pyannote.audio**: NumPy 2.0 compatibility merged but not released
- **Community solution**: Well-maintained and actively used
- **Expected resolution**: Official support likely by mid-2025

The WhisperX community has effectively bridged the compatibility gap. The `whisperx-numpy2-compatibility` package represents a mature solution that thousands of users rely on daily. For production use, combine this with proper environment isolation to ensure stability.

## Immediate action steps

1. **For quick resolution**: Install `whisperx-numpy2-compatibility`
2. **For production systems**: Deploy WhisperX in Docker container
3. **For development**: Use virtual environment with NumPy <2.0
4. **For future-proofing**: Monitor WhisperX GitHub issue #927 for official updates

Your TikTok-style video use case specifically benefits from WhisperX's superior word-level timing accuracy, making it worth implementing one of these compatibility solutions rather than switching to alternatives. The community package or Docker isolation provide the most reliable paths forward without compromising your existing NumPy 2.0+ dependencies.
